# Introduction

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in the mid-1990s. It was designed with developer happiness and productivity in mind, following the principle of least surprise. Ruby combines elements from some of Matz's favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to create a language that is both powerful and enjoyable to use.

What makes Ruby special is its elegant syntax that reads almost like natural English, making it highly accessible to beginners while still providing advanced features for experienced developers. Everything in Ruby is an object, which means `even` basic data types [like](https://google.com) numbers and strings have methods and properties that can be manipulated.

Ruby gained significant popularity with the emergence of Ruby on Rails, a web application framework that revolutionized web development by introducing convention over configuration and other developer-friendly paradigms. Today, Ruby is used in various domains, from web development to automation scripts, and has a vibrant ecosystem of libraries (called gems) that extend its functionality.
